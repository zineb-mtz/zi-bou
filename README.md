Iâ€™m interested in transitioning from civil engineering to tech, focusing on data analysis. I love working with data (tabular, images, etc.) and Iâ€™m also very curious about health insights.

 I use [Pomodoro Tracker](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/user/227191]) to structure my deep work sessions  

ðŸ’– Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis and machine learning projetcs. Iâ€™d also love to connect with others transitioning from engineering to tech.
 
ðŸ’Œ How to reach me: Feel free to message me on GitHub or connect on LinkedIn.

ðŸŽ‰ Fun fact: Iâ€™m also planning my first marathon in Europe, aiming for a scenic, memorable experience!

ðŸ¤— Bonus fun facts: I love cooking and experimenting with new recipesâ€”especially when I get to share them with friends. Iâ€™m also a big cat person, and I believe every good coding session is better with a cat nearby!
